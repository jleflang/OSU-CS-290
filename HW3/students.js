  /* Your program should output the following to the console.log, including each of the opening and closing

  have to sort the array of students using each comparator and then loop through the array and and call logMe
  on each student of the now-sorted array. If the argument is 'true' then it prints the student's name, major, 
  year in school, and club affiliation. If the argument is 'false' then the club affiliation is ommited and 
  just the student's name, major and year in school is logged. Please carefully note which sorted results require
  the club to be displayed and which do not.
